Q1: I would prefer uising the second stype if I have to work on a program that I were running remotely. It is much faster [especially when you do not have a local ssh key].

Q2: If the project/task is very long, I would probably prefer the first style. It takes longer time, but if you make mistakes, editing locally makes it easier to catch and fix the errors. If it is short and easy to debug, I would prefer the second style.
